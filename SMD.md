# Myth #1: We have always done it this way
* A dangerous phrase that prevents innovation and adaptation to changing threats and environments
* Examples: using passwords, relying on antivirus software, trusting certificates
* Tips: question why we do things a certain way, look for better alternatives, embrace change

*--

# Myth #2: I want/I wish
* A common attitude that expresses a desire for something without considering the costs, risks, or feasibility of achieving it
* Examples: wanting perfect security, wishing for zero bugs, expecting magic solutions
* Tips: be realistic, weigh the pros and cons, use evidence-based solutions

*--

# Myth #3: The user is the weakest link
* A popular belief that blames the users for most of the security breaches and incidents
* Examples: phishing, ransomware, social engineering
* Tips: don't blame the users, give them proper training, guidance, and tools, empower and motivate them to report and prevent attacks

*--

# Myth #4: Best practices are best
* A misleading notion that implies that there is a one-size-fits-all solution for every security challenge
* Examples: following standards, guidelines, or checklists blindly, copying what others do without understanding why or how
* Tips: evaluate the suitability and effectiveness of any practice for your specific situation and goals, customize and tailor your solutions, keep learning and updating your knowledge

*--

# Myth #5: Technology will deal with it
* A naive assumption that trusts technology to handle all the security issues without human intervention or oversight
* Examples: relying on encryption, firewalls, or biometrics alone, ignoring human and organizational aspects of security
* Tips: don't trust technology blindly, check for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or misuse, address awareness, culture, and ethics issues

# Conclusion
* Faulty assumptions and magical thinking can derail our cybersecurity efforts and expose us to risks
* We need to develop critical thinking skills, avoid cognitive biases, and adopt a scientific mindset in cybersecurity
* We also need to learn from our mistakes, share our experiences, and collaborate with others to improve our security posture
